# üîç CSV Upload Debug Guide

## Current Issue
"Import Failed - No clients could be imported" error is occurring.

## Debug Steps

### 1. Open Browser Console
1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Clear the console (`Ctrl+L` or click clear button)

### 2. Try Upload Again
1. Upload your `Untitled.csv` file
2. Watch the console for these debug messages:

#### Expected Console Messages:
```
=== BULK UPLOAD STARTED ===
File: Untitled.csv Size: [some number]
Field mapping received: [object or undefined]
File text preview (first 200 chars): First name,Last name,Phone,Email,Source...
CSV Headers detected: ["First name", "Last name", "Phone", "Email", "Source"]
Parsed CSV rows: 65 rows
Sample row: {First name: "Jass", Last name: "Sidhu", ...}
Field mapping validation: {fieldMapping: {...}, hasName: true, hasEmail: true, hasPhone: true, isValid: true}
Processing row: 1 {...}
Mapped data: {firstName: "Jass", lastName: "Sidhu", email1: "jass2sidhu@live.ca", phone1: "19057820114"}
Validation result for row 1: {valid: true/false, errors: [...]}
```

### 3. Check for Issues

#### Issue A: Field Mapping Problem
If you see:
```
Field mapping received: undefined
```
Or:
```
Field mapping validation: {isValid: false}
```
**Solution**: The field mapping step is not working properly.

#### Issue B: CSV Parsing Problem
If you see:
```
Parsed CSV rows: 0 rows
```
**Solution**: CSV parsing failed - file format issue.

#### Issue C: Validation Failure
If you see:
```
Row X failed validation: [errors]
FINAL VALIDATION SUMMARY:
Valid clients: 0
```
**Solution**: All rows are failing validation - check validation rules.

### 4. Quick Test
Create a simple test file with just 2 rows:
```csv
First name,Last name,Phone,Email
John,Doe,5551234567,john@test.com
Jane,Smith,5557654321,jane@test.com
```
